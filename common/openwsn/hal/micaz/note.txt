Q: how to porting OpenWSN to micaz platform?
R:
MicaZ uses Atmega128L and cc2420 transceiver. and the GAINZ hardware is almost the same as mica. So porting OpenWSN from GAINZ hardware to MicaZ should be pretty simple.

Since we haven't MicaZ nodes(they're truly expensive at first for us), this project hasn't been really started. If someone interested in it, you can contact with us.

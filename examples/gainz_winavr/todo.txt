re-organize examples for the following networks

- pointer to pointer 
  - based on transceiver
  - based on mac
  - wlsmodem
  - wlscable

for star network

starnode
starsink
stargatw
starmodem


for flood networks
flood_node
flood_sink
flood_gateway

for mesh networks

mesh_node
mesh_router
mesh_sink
mesh_gateway

for datatree data collection protocol

dtp_node
dtp_gateway

for gradient routing

gradient_node
gradient_sink/gateway


for general sensor

wlssensor：this is an important project demonstrate how to develop an wireless sensor
wlssink (only for test)
wlsgatw (for real applications)

eliminate the following:
因为它们的层次不清楚

fullnode
gatwsink(contains wlssensor)
sinknode
sensornode

- Move this directory from "node/gainz-winavr" into "examples/gainz-winavr".
This will lead to the compiling failure if you use AVRStudio to open the projects directly.
However, you can remove the files and add it again by force AVRStudio to update file link information.

This folder "winavr" is used to keep the testing/demonstration programs developed by winavr. 

Developing envionment is: 

- Windows OS 
- WinAVR + AVRStudio 
or WinAVR + Code::Blocks

We OpenWSN team is using Portable WinAVR and AVRStudio. The projects can be opened directly using AVR Studio and compiled successfully. 

Attention: 
If you found the AVR Studio complains "cannot find file", then you can search for the file and add it directly into the project.

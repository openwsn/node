sinksensor
===================================================================
This is a test program for gateway testing only. The sinksensor program will do the following: 

- accept REQUEST packet from gateway computer throught RS232 and start sampling according to REQUEST indication;
- encapsulate sampled data as RESPONSE and send it back to the gateway computer through RS232

- periodically sampling the luminance and send it to the gateway computer as VARDATA packet

- broadcast what received from the gateway computer through the wireless transceiver. 


Q: difference between sinksensor and gatwsink?
R: 
- sinksensor is mainly for testing (maybe changed frequently and may have more bugs)
- gatwsink is an serious program for robust real applications (should be stable)



sinksensor
===================================================================
sinksensor是一个以测试为目的的程序:

- 它会辨识来自gateway computer通过RS232送过来的packet,并对其进行解析,如发现是REQUEST类型包,则启动采样过程,并将采样后的结果封装成RESPONSE类型包回送给gateway computer.
-> 至于gateway computer上运行一个gateway程序,该程序的行为不受sinksensor控制

- 周期性采集luminance sensor数据并封装成VARDATA数据包发给gateway computer

- 对收到的来自gateway computer的数据包通过无线通信口广播出去

introduction
======================================================
this is an cc2420 based cama/ca protocol implementation.

the sending process is as the following:

1. check whether the channel is empty (CCA). if it's not empty, then wait for a random time and restart the sending processing again when the wait period expired.

check: if the current frame has been tried to sent for more than 3 times, then give up and return false to its upper layer.

2. send the frame out by sending the frame to cc2420 hardware transceiver

3. after sending the frame, the sender should wait for its reply till some time. 

4. if got ACK, then clear the frame from sender's internal buffer.
if got NAK or timeout, then restart the sending process later.



the receiving process is as the following:

1. accept incoming frame

2. if this is a data frame, then sent ACK/NAK frame back imdiately. 
if ACK, recorded the sequence number.
if ACK, put the frame inside the local buffer and wait for other applications to read it out or else fire the listener.

3. if this ACK/NAK frame
search for specified frame inside local buffer. 
if ACK, then seaching the frame inside local buffer and delete it. if not found, then do nothing.
if NAK, then seaching the frame inside local buffer. if success, then restart the sending process. if failed, then simply ignore this frame. 

4. if this is command frame
the treat it as a data frame and call the mac command interpreter.
